# Calories-Burnt-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This project aims to predict the number of calories burnt during physical activity using machine learning regression techniques. It leverages a real-world dataset containing physiological data to build a reliable model for health and fitness tracking applications.
Objective
To create a machine learning model that accurately predicts calories burnt based on variables such as age, gender, weight, height, duration of exercise, heart rate, and body temperature.
